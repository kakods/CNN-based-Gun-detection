# CNN-based-Gun-detection
This project has been developed using the fastai library (Thanks to Jeremy Howard and Rachel Thomas) and taking inspiration from Sylvian Gugger and Jeremy Howard's code.
The folder dataset contains only the split version of our dataset. Details have been given in the report chapter 4.
The source code is given in a jupyter notebook format. Implementation details have been given in chapter 6 of the report.
This code should be run on a machine with single GPU with support for cuda and fastai version 1.0.53 installed.
Additionally we have provided weights of the model which was trained by us. The weights are based on Pytorch library.
